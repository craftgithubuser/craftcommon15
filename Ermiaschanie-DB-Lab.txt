5. Define the importance of Relation Database Management System(RDBMS)?
ANS; - Data consistency across applications and database copies
     - Increased usability without complex structure or queries
     - Data that's enterprise accessible and AI ready

6. As we all know that there are Two types of Database. Relational
Database(SQL) AND Non-Relational DB(NO sql). what is the difference between
them.
ANS:

  - PostgreSQL
  - DB2
  - Microsoft access

9. Define and Describe Whatis Structured Query Language(SQL)?(SQL)?

    -Is a standard Database language which is used to create, maintain and retrieve the relational database.

10. List and Describe each of the different subsets of SQL(Mean DDL, DML,
DCL, TCL)?
ANS:
    There are three main subsets of the SQL language:.
    1,Data Definition Language (DDL).Data Control Language (DCL).
    2,Data Manipulation Language (DML)
    3,Data Control Language (DCL).
    4,Transaction Control Language(TCL)
  - DML is used to retrieve and manipulate data in the table such as to insert, delete, and update data. 
  - DDL is used to define data structures such as to create, alter, or drop tables
  - DCL is used to control access to data in a database such as to grant or revokespecified users' rights to perform specified tasks.
  - TCL SQL Statements that allows you to control and manage transactions to maintain the integrity of data within SQL statements.
    
11. what is table in Database(DB)?
ANS; 
    -  Tables are database objects that contain all the data in a database. In tables, data is logically organized in a row-and-column format similar to a spreadsheet.

12. what is column and Row(tuples) in table?
