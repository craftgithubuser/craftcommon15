6.     As we all know that there are Two types of Database. Relational Database(SQL) AND Non-Relational DB(NO sql). what is the difference between them.
         =  SQL databases defines & manipulates data based structured query languge.
         = SQL Scalability in almost all situations
         = SQL database have fixed or static or predifined schema.
         = SQL database are the best suited for complex queries.
         = NonSQL database has dynamic schema for unstructured data. data is stored in many ways which means it can be docoment oriented, column oriented, graph based or organized as a key value store.
         =NonSQL non relational database have dynamic Schema.

7. 	List examples of Relation Database Management System(RDBMS)?

          = MYSQL, ORACLE DATABASE, POSTGRE SQL, MONGODB, INFORMIX, SYBASE, ARORA DB 

8.       List examples of Non-Relational DB(Nosql)? 

           = MONGODB, APACHE CASS HANDRA, REDIS, COUCHBASE & APACHE HABASE

9.       Define and Describe is Structured Query Language(SQL)?


           =  SQL is the core of a relational database which is used for accessing &managing the db and also used to define tables and structures. it is standardized language from interacting with RDMS. mainly used to perform CRUD(create, read, update and delet) operations.)


10.       List and Describe each of the different subsets of SQL(Mean DDL, DML, DCL, TCL)?

            = DML:- it allows you to insert, update, delete and retrieve data from the database. they are not auto - committed. it means chane are not permanent to database, they can be rolled back.
            =DCL:- the commands to grant and take athority from any database user. it allows you to control access to the database. Ex. Grant or Revoke access permissions.
