10. List and Describe each of the different subsets of SQL(Mean DDL, DML, DCL, TCL)?

              DDL(Data Definition Language)    
     - It allows you to perform various operations  on the DataBase.
     - All DDL commands are auto-committed. That means it saves  all the changes permanently  in the database.
             
             DML(Data Manipulation Language)
