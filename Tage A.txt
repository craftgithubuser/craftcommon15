1.     what is Data?
   Data base is systematic collactions of data, that represent some real world entites.

 
2.      what is Information?
       
  Information is stimuli that has meaning in some context for its receiver. 
 
 
3.      what is Database(DB)?
 
  A database (DB), in the most general sense, is an organized collection of data. More specifically, 
  a database is an electronic system that allows data to be easily accessed, manipulated and updated

4.      What is the Relation Database Management System(RDBMS)?
 The software used to store, manage, query, and retrieve data stored in a relational database is called 
a relational database management system (RDBMS).
 The RDBMS provides an interface between users and applications and the database, 
as well as administrative functions for managing data storage, access, and performance. 

 
5.      Define the importance of Relation Database Management System(RDBMS)?
 The RDBMS provides an interface between users and applications and the database, 
as well as administrative functions for managing data storage, access, and performance. 

6.     As we all know that there are Two types of Database. Relational Database(SQL) AND Non-Relational DB(NO sql).
       what is the difference between them.
 
 SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational databases. 
(Relational databases model data as records in rows and tables with logical links between them).
 NoSQL is a class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL.


7. List examples of Relation Database Management System(RDBMS)?

 Some examples of specific systems that use RDBMS include IBM, Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQLServer and PostgreSQL.
 
 
8.       List examples of Non-Relational DB(Nosql)?

NoSQL or non-relational databases examples:MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase and Apache HBase.
 
 
9.       Define and Describe is Structured Query Language(SQL)?
 
 Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them.


10.       List and Describe each of the different subsets of SQL(Mean DDL, DML, DCL, TCL)?
 
DDl stads for Data definition language
 It is a computer language used to create and modify the structure of database objects in a database.
DML stands for Data Manipulation Language
DCL stands for data control language
TCL stands for Tool Command Language.


11.      what is table in Database(DB)?

 A table is a collection of related data held in a table format within a database. 
 It consists of columns and rows. In relational databases, and flat file
 
 
12.     what is column and Row(tuples) in table?
A relation, also known as a table or file, is a subset of the Cartesian product of a list of domains characterized by a name. 
And within a table, each row represents a group of related data values. A row, or record, is also known as a tuple.
 The columns in a table is a field and is also referred to as an attribute.
